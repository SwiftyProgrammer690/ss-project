# Introduction

The Egyptians beleived that whatever you do in your present life, reflects on your afterlife (meaning that religion and culture are connected). For example, if you were a good, noble man/woman, you have been considered to have a good afterlife and make it to the "heavens" of life. If the person was a total opposite, it would be considered as that person not passing the "weighing of the heart" and not going to the "heavens". Well, what is the "weighing of the heart" you may ask, and i'm here to answer that!

# The Weighing of the Heart

When one is going through the underworld to reach the afterlife, they face many obstacles such as monsters and curses, but their biggest challenge is the weighing of the heart. The "weighing of the heart" is the process where Anubis weighs the persons heart against a feather. If the heart is lighter than the feather (meaning the soul is true and good), the person would successfully proceed to the afterlife. Otherwise, they must live in the underworld until they cease to exist even after death. To prevent this from happening, they would put a heart scarab on their heart to protect the heart from saying any true things that might affect Anubis' decision during the mummification process.

# The Heart

The heart has two parts. The Ba and the Ka. The Ka part of your heart is your "living part" and can eat and drink in the afterlife. It is most put to use though, in your present life. On the other had, the Ba is very free and has lot's of control over what it's doing after death. In fact, it is the Ba (along with some prayers called "Saku") that will go onto the journey of going to the afterlife. This is why Egyptians care a lot about the heart in the mummification process

# How Are Egyptian Religion and Culture Connected?

Egyptian religion and culture are connected because it is beleived that whatever you do in your present life, is reflected onto your afterlife. They were careful about how many wrong things they have done in their life because their ultimate goal in life was to go to the afterlife. It's like beign careful about how wrongs things you do for Santa, but for the Egyptians, its all their life instead of one year.
